**"Dungeons of Garmage"** is a choose-your-own-adventure game that transports players to a fictional dungeon in a strange fantasy land. Players become immersed in a sense of dread and adventure, and are provided with the ability to choose their own path in the game. The idea is for players to select between various choices presented by the game, leading to different endings based on their decisions.

### Design Choices
This project was design to work with terminal, as such, the choice of style was limited, but I used the Rich a python module to provide as much context in the events of the game via text formatting. That way I can share a feeling with the player by using text formatting alone.
